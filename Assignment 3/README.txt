This program aims to generate a huffman tree and corresponding message code
for a select few languages. English, Russian, Japenese, and Arabic


The two goals for this project were:
1. Run for three of the given languages listed above

2. Generate sets of n frequencies at random and run for increasing n. 
Time the execution of 
(1) building the initial heap keyed with the frequencies;
(2) the complete generation of the Huffman tree. 
Graph the times as a function of n.


HOW TO RUN:

This is a python file, using python's 3.11.8 64-bit interpreter. 
Run ' ./huffman_codes.py ' in the terminal (for windows & python3) or simply hit the run button on an IDE.
